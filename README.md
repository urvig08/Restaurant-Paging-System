# Restaurant-Paging-System
The aim of the project is to make the MicaZ motes which are wireless sensor motes work as pagers that could be used in restaurants to give indications to the customer about a vacant table that the customer requested for. It makes use of the serial communication between the computer and mote and wireless communication between two motes to make the paging system functional between the restaurant server and the customer.
